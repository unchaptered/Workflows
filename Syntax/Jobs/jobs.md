# Jobs

A workflow run is made up of one or more `jobs`, which run in parallel by default.

To run jobs sequentially, you can define dependencies on other jobs using the jobs.<job_id\>.needs keyword.

Each job runs in a runner environment specified by `runs-on`.

ðŸ¤”

You can run an unlimited number of jobs as long as you are within the workflow usage limits.

    my_first_job:
        name: My first job

    my_second_job:
        name: MY second job
```

### âœ… permission

You can grant permission of `GITHUB_TOKEN`, to allow the minimum access.

To grant permission of token.

- each job in worflows
- all job in wokrflows

# Free Access
permissions: read-all | write-all

# Deny Access
permissions: {}

# Partially Access
permissions:
    actions: read | write | none
    # more than many options ..
```

You can to grant Permission of specific jobs.

```yaml
jobs:
    stale:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        permission:
            issues: write
            pull-requests: write
        
        steps:

```

### âœ… needs

If you want `Serialized Process` of one process.

You can connect several jobs using needs options.

    job2:
        needs: job1

    job3:
        needs: [ job1, job2]
```

These jobs is serially runned **job1 > job2 > job3** using need option.

#### need.alyways

You can use conditions to `branch out` process.

```yaml
name: example-workflow

on: [ push ]

jobs:
    production-deploy:
        it: github.repository == 'octo-org/octo-repo-prod'

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

```

### âœ… runs-on

You can choose `System Type` in Github/Your Hosting Runner.

#### Reccomendation Option 

- ubuntu-latest

#### References

- `-latest` is provided image from Github.

Use `job.<job_id>.environment` to define the environment that the job references.

All envrionment protection rules must pass before a job referencing the environment is sent to a runner.

ðŸ¤”

You can provide the environment as only the environment `name`, or as an environment object with the `name` or `url`.

The URL maps to `environment_url` in the deployment API.

#### job.<job_id>.steps[*].name

A name for your step to display on Github

```yaml

```

#### job.<job_id>.steps[*].id

A unique identifier for the step.

You can use the `id` to reference the step in contexts.

- link to latest docs in official docs [> Click](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#about-contexts)

#### job.<job_id>.steps[*].if

You can use the `if` conditional to prevent a step from running unless a condition is met.

```yaml
# using context
steps:
    - name: My first step
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
      run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.

# using status check functions

    - name: My backup step
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      uses: actions/heroku@1.0.0

# using secrets
name: Run a step if a secret has been set

jobs:
    my-jobname:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        env:
            super_secret: ${{ secrets.SuperSecret }}
        
        steps:
            - if: ${{ env.super_secret != ''}}
              run: echo 'This step will only run if the secret has a value set'
            
            - if: ${{ env.super_secret == ''}}
              run: echo 'This step will only run if the secret does not have a value set'
```

#### job.<job_id>.steps[*].uses

If you include the version fo the action, specifying...

- Git ref
- SHA
- Docker tag number

You need to exactly type Version of Action.

Bad Sinario, when you don't type Version.

- Using the commit SHA of a released action version is the safest for stability and security.
- Using the specific major action version allows you to receive cirical fixes and security patches while still maintaining compatibility.
    It also assures that your workflow should still work.
- Using the default branh of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major version with a breaking change, your worflow could break.

### âœ… Timeout-minutes

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` expires when a jo finishes or after a maximum of 24 hours.

For self-hosted runner, the token may be the limiting factor if the job timeout is greater than 24 hours.

THe location and version of a reusable workflow file to run as a job.

Use one of the following syntaxes...
